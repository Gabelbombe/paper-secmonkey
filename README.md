If you are working on cloud technologies and specifically cloud security, the first few questions you would get should be around security, data safety, cost effectiveness etc. Additionally, companies in the FinTech and Healthcare sectors may be concerned about how secure cloud technologies can be for them.

Based on my considerable experience and battle scars, I would recommend looking at Security Monkey which was open sourced in 6/30/2014.

### So, What is Security Monkey?

Security Monkey is an OpenSource application from Netflix which monitors, alerts and reports one or multiple AWS accounts for anomalies. Security Monkey can run on an Amazon EC2 (AWS) instance, Google Cloud Platform (GCP) instance (Google Cloud Platform), or OpenStack (public or private cloud) instance. While Security Monkey's main purpose is security, it also proves a useful tool for tracking down potential problems as it is essentially a change tracking system.

Security Monkey has been an invaluable tool that you will honestly end up using everyday. Referencing here is my chrome browser history reflecting my usage statistics,
